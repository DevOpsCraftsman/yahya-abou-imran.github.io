Add unit tests and CI/CD workflow to an exiting Python project


I can implement unit tests and add use continuous integration tool to your project.
By analysing the situation, I can choose the correct solutions and bring you quality control methods.
Test your code again several versions of python, define code standards, forbid release without a certain amount of test coverage or style evaluation…
All of this is a part of this service.

Unit testing frameworks and tools:
  • unittest
  • pytest
  • tox
  • coverage

Style and code standard evaluation:
  • pylint
  • mypy

CI/CD:
  • Git
  • Github / GitLab
  • Jenkins
  • Docker
