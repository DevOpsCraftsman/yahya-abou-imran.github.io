Add unit tests & CI to a Python project


I can implement unit tests and add use continuous integration tool to your project.
By analyzing the situation, I can choose the correct solutions and bring you quality control methods.
Test your code against several versions of python, define code standards, forbid release without a certain amount of test coverage or style evaluation…
All of this is a part of this service.

  • unittest
  • pytest
  • tox
  • coverage

  • pylint
  • mypy
